## Intoduction
Making a game has always been a goal of mine, so when an open ended assignment came up in a programming class, where I could make anything in any software, I figurd it was the perfect opprotunity to improve my programming abilities and make a game in unity. 

## The Idea for the Game
The premise for the game is essentially controlling two characters with inverted controls at the same time. This idea came when brainstorming ways to make a simple platformer more complex and new to the player. This simple game mechanic was chosen as it could lead to many interesting level designs where you would need to carefully pay attention to multiple things at the same time, making it a mix of strategy and platformer.

## The Code
This game took a lot of code to create. There were 22 different scripts which varyed from 30 lines to 400 lines; so this section will function more as an overview rather than a comprehensive analysis of all of it.
