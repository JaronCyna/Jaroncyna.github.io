## Introduction
For my third year in VEX robotics, I wanted to improve my performance from previous years. To do this, much more planning and rigor went into each step of the design process, which will be shown below.

## Starter Ideas
After first seeing the game announcement, I Immediately got to work writing down plausible ideas and discussing the intricacies of the game. After having some time to let the idea of the game, I created the CAD model shown below:

This design had benifits such as
- Mecanum wheels allowing for easy strafing
- 4 wheel drive for extra torque on the drive train
- Simple flywheel Mechanism likely easy to repair if damaged
- Dual Flywheel system for added compression

However, after thinking about it more, core design flaws appeared leading me to consider a redesign, these include:
- Inefficient use of motors
- Difficulties in getting the two flywheels to be identical in speed could lead to weird flight paths
- The mechanism shown for intaking disks likely does not have enough friction to stop sliding
- Due to the Mecanum wheels, the drivetrain is quite slow as extra torque is important.

Although this design could work in theory, I felt it would be much harder to bring to life than if I made a more effective redesign.
