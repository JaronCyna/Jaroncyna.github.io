## Introduction
An engineering project that has been a goal of mine for a long time is making a device inspired by biology. Whether that be an arm, hand or something unrelated, the idea seemed like it could be a fun challenge which could develop my problem-solving abilities while making something that could have a useful application. After some thought, I landed on building a robot arm due to the versatility that it could bring.

## Brainstorming
There are several factors to consider when making a robot arm. First of all, the size of the arm helps to narrow the goal of the arm. Then once determined, the number of joints is vital to decide on so the CAD model can be developed to incorperate the proper number of motors, and moving parts
