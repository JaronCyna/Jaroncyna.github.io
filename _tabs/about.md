I am currently a second year Engineering Physcis and Electrical Engineering student at Queen's University. I am the Electrical Power Systems lead on the Satillite Team and the Firmware Lead on the Rover Team. I am interested in embedded and firmware engineering, electronics/PCB design, and FPGA programming/validation.
